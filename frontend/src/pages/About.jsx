            Heart & Bloom was created to bridge the gap between parenting intention and developmental action.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe the early years shape everything. Instead of random toys and screen time, children need intentional stimulation across all developmental domains.

          <p>
            Our kits are structured, expert-designed, and built to strengthen the parent-child bond.
